QuiryAI

## Project Description    
_What have you built during the hackathon?_

I created QuiryAI, a fully functional AI-powered dynamic form builder that combines the intelligence of Google Gemini AI with the robust backend capabilities of Appwrite. The application allows users to create beautiful, responsive forms in two ways: through natural language descriptions that AI converts into functional forms, or through a manual drag-and-drop interface for complete control. The platform features real-time form preview, smart validation, secure user authentication, and comprehensive form analytics - all wrapped in a sleek dark theme using Appwrite's Pink Design System.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_

The inspiration for QuiryAI came from experiencing the frustration of creating forms for various projects - from simple contact forms to complex surveys. Traditional form builders often require extensive manual configuration, while coding forms from scratch is time-consuming and repetitive. I envisioned a solution that could bridge this gap by leveraging AI to understand natural language requirements and instantly generate functional forms, while still providing the flexibility of manual editing when needed. The goal was to democratize form creation, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users while maintaining professional quality and robust functionality through Appwrite's powerful backend services.
